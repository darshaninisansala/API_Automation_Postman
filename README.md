API Automation with Postman

This repository contains API automation tests for JSONPlaceholder
 using Postman and Newman.
The tests cover standard CRUD operations and also document unconventional API behaviors.

Contents

JSONPlaceholder_API_Tests.postman_collection.json — Postman collection for API tests

reports/ (optional) — HTML reports generated by Newman

README.md — This file

Base URL
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Tests Included
1. Get All Posts

Method: GET

Endpoint: /posts

Assertions:

Status code is 200

Response contains a list of posts

2. Get Single Post

Method: GET

Endpoint: /posts/{id}

Assertions:

Status code is 200

Response contains post with requested ID

3. Create a Post

Method: POST

Endpoint: /posts

Payload: JSON object with title, body, userId

Assertions:

Status code is 201

Response contains the newly created post

4. Update a Post

Method: PUT

Endpoint: /posts/{id}

Payload: Updated title, body, userId

Assertions:

Status code is 200

Response reflects updated values

5. Unconventional Behavior Tests
Step	Action	Endpoint	Observations
1	PUT to create new ID	/posts/10001	Normally, POST is used to create. Using PUT for a non-existing ID is unconventional.
2	POST to update existing ID	/posts/101	POST is typically used for creation. Updating with POST is unconventional.
3	GET to simulate DELETE	/posts/101	GET cannot delete. Normally, DELETE method should be used. Logging this scenario helps highlight potential API misuse.
Assertions & Validations

Verify HTTP status codes for each request

Validate response body fields

Log unconventional behaviors with explanations

Running Tests with Newman

Install Newman:

npm install -g newman
npm install -g newman-reporter-html


Run the collection:

newman run JSONPlaceholder_API_Tests.postman_collection.json -r cli,html


HTML report will be generated in newman/ folder (if specified).

Notes / Observations

JSONPlaceholder is a fake online REST API, so PUT, POST, DELETE are simulated.

Documenting unconventional behavior helps in understanding API design limitations.

This project demonstrates ability to handle standard API testing and edge-case/unexpected scenarios.
